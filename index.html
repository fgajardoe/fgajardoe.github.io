# Bit Polymerase

Welcome to this space dedicated to share whatever I find interesting or inspiring from my day-to-day work as bioinformatician researching genomics and my point-of-view as human individual living the first decades of the 2000 DC. This includes -but is not limited to- short toughts, drawings, reads, data, music, assays, etc.

I hope you enjoy.
